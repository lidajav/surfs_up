## Project Overview

This project is to create two queries from Measurment Table to get the tempretures for months of June and Decemebr

- Sqlalchemy library was imported to use SQLite engine for our queries.  
- The query results for months of june and December were respectively saved in dataframes called june_df and dec_df
- The project also calculated and printed out the summary for [June](june.png) and [December](dec.png) tempratures. 

## Results:

- The temrature has been registered in June 12% more than December. 
- The average tempreture in June is 75 degree versus 71 in December
- The data on tempreture for December is more spread out than the ones in June. 
- The tempreture in December can get as high as tempreture in June.
  
   
  
## Summary :

### Recomendations:

 Based on our queries and the statistics, we may want to look at more data for month of december and the stations that recorded the tempretures as the data is more spread out in December. We can also look at the station(s) who has recorded most of data and run these two queries for it. 
 By relying on current data, it seems we have a pretty consistent tempreture all across the year as we measured for the warmest and coldest months.The max tempreture are very close, 
 however the minimum tempreture drops by 12% from 64 degree in June to 56 in December.
